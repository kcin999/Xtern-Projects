## Deliverables
1. Clean and organize your data set then present the data as a table or data frame. 
2. Cluster housing, restaurants, event, conference locations to pick out the most convenient coworking space. 
3. Review the data and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set you gathered. 
4. Present a sample 10-week activities plan with event date, event location and event detail.

## Data Files:
#### Note: I filtered down times from May 15, 2022 to August 13, 2022, the approximate time we would be in Indinaplis
[address.csv](address.csv)
* Contains the information from the given data file. 
[raw_eventbrite.json](raw_eventbrite.json)
* Raw EventBrite Data after scanning it
[eventbrite.csv](eventbrite.csv)
* Cleaned EventBrite Data
[eventsInIndy.csv](eventsInIndy.csv)
* Different Events from both [DowntownIndy](https://www.downtownindy.org/happening-downtown/) and [VisitIndy](https://www.visitindy.com/indianapolis-things-to-do-events)

## Notes:
* Idea for how to get event brite data came from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsLuV_Oc9h0 
	* This is due to the fact that the eventbrite search API was turned off for public use
